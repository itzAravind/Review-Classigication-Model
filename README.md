**Restaurant Reviews Analysis**

This project aims to analyze customer reviews for restaurants and gain insights into what customers think about various aspects of a restaurant such as food quality, ambience, customer service, and more. To achieve this, the project involves training two models:

**1. A model for classifying restaurant reviews into different categories such as food taste, price, quantity, and more.**


**2. An advanced analytics model for analyzing the categorized reviews to understand whether the review of each category is positive or negative.
The project uses Simple Transformers, BERT algorithm, RoBERTa algorithm, and sentiment analysis to gain insights from customer reviews.**

**Research Methodology**
The project is divided into two phases. Phase I involves classifying the reviews into different categories, and Phase II involves performing advanced analytics on the categorized reviews to understand the strength and weakness of the restaurant.

**Transformer Model**
The transformer model is a recent development in the field of data science and deep learning, mainly used for sophisticated natural language processing applications. The neural network in the transformer model tracks relationships in sequential input, such as the words in a phrase, to learn the context and subsequently, the meaning of the phrase. This model has demonstrated to be very efficient for typical natural language processing tasks.

**Simple Transformers**
Simple Transformers is an open-source library that simplifies the training of models by reducing complexity and allowing users to focus on model training and exploring other Transformer model architectures. It offers two classification models, ClassificationModel and MultiLabelClassificationModel, which are task-specific. The project uses the RoBERTa algorithm for classification and trains the model using the classificationModel class of Simple Transformers.

**RoBERTa Algorithm**
RoBERTa is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is a free and open-source framework of machine learning used for natural language processing. RoBERTa uses a different tokenizer than BERT, byte-level BPE, and has a larger vocabulary.

**Sentiment Analysis**
Sentiment analysis is a method for examining a text to unearth the sentiment it contains. In this project, after classification, the classified reviews are analyzed again using the RoBERTa base algorithm of the BinaryClassification model to study the sentiment of the reviews. Sentiment analysis helps to analyze reviews by identifying areas for improvement and areas where the restaurant is performing well. The analysis indicates whether the review is positive or negative.

**Conclusion**
This project uses machine learning techniques such as Simple Transformers, BERT algorithm, RoBERTa algorithm, and sentiment analysis to gain insights from customer reviews for restaurants. It offers a powerful approach to analyze the strength and weakness of a restaurant based on customer feedback, and by doing so, it can help restaurant owners to make informed decisions about future improvements of their business.
